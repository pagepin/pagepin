description: Deploy an HTML page, Markdown file, image, or multi-file static site to a pagepin host and get a shareable URL — pagepin renders Markdown and images in a viewer — then run the pin-point review-comment loop (read comments, fix, redeploy, resolve). Use when the user wants to publish, share, preview, host, or update a page / site / report / README / .md / .html file, "deploy to pagepin", get a link for a file, or address review comments on a hosted page. 需要把 HTML、Markdown、图片或静态站点部署到 pagepin、生成可分享链接、或处理页面评论时使用。

# pagepin — deploy static pages from your agent

pagepin is a static-page host. You deploy one or more files and get back a
shareable `…/<handle>/<slug>/` URL. Pages are private (login required) by
default; a site can be made public for a bounded window.

Everything below is plain `curl` against the pagepin HTTP API — there is no CLI
or SDK to install. The token never goes into the chat.

## Step 1 — resolve the base URL and token

```bash
# Base URL of the pagepin instance (scheme + host, no trailing slash):
PAGEPIN_BASE="${PAGEPIN_BASE:-$(cat ~/.config/pagepin/host 2>/dev/null)}"
# Personal Access Token (PAT):
PP_TOKEN="${PAGEPIN_TOKEN:-$(cat ~/.config/pagepin/token 2>/dev/null)}"
```

- **Base URL.** If you obtained this guide by fetching `https://HOST/skill.md`,
  then `PAGEPIN_BASE` is that origin (`https://HOST`). Otherwise use
  `$PAGEPIN_BASE`, or `~/.config/pagepin/host`, or **ask the user for their
  pagepin host once** and save it: `mkdir -p ~/.config/pagepin && printf '%s' "https://HOST" > ~/.config/pagepin/host`.
- **Token.** If `PP_TOKEN` is empty, run *First-time login* below — **never ask
  the user to paste a token, and never print it.** If any later call returns
  `401`, the token is expired or revoked: re-run *First-time login*, save the new
  token, and retry the request — don't fall back to asking the user to paste one.

Verify the token and look up the handle / quota any time:

```bash
curl -fsS "$PAGEPIN_BASE/api/me" -H "Authorization: Bearer $PP_TOKEN"
```

## Step 2 — first-time login (only when there is no token)

Get a token through the browser (OAuth 2.0 device flow, RFC 8628) instead of
pasting one:

1. `POST $PAGEPIN_BASE/api/device/code` → returns `user_code`,
   `verification_uri_complete`, `device_code`, `interval`, `expires_in`.
2. Tell the user: open `verification_uri_complete` and confirm the `user_code`.
3. Poll `POST $PAGEPIN_BASE/api/device/token` with `{"device_code":"…"}` every
   `interval` seconds. Each response is `{"status":"pending"}` (keep polling),
   `{"status":"denied"}` / `{"status":"expired"}` (stop), or
   `{"status":"approved","token":"pp_…"}`.
4. On approval, persist the token (skip the file write in CI / shared machines —
   keep it only in `$PAGEPIN_TOKEN` for the session):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/pagepin \
  && printf '%s' "$TOKEN" > ~/.config/pagepin/token \
  && chmod 600 ~/.config/pagepin/token
```

## Step 3 — deploy / update (one endpoint, each call = one atomic version)

`files` and `paths` come in pairs and may repeat. Re-deploying the same `slug`
updates it (atomic new version, rollback-able). `slug`: lowercase
letters/digits/hyphens, ≤64 chars.

```bash
# Single file — index.html is the safest paths value
curl -fsS -X POST "$PAGEPIN_BASE/api/sites/my-demo/deploy" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PP_TOKEN" \
  -F "files=@report.html" -F "paths=index.html"

# Multi-file build output (repeat the files/paths pair per file)
curl -fsS -X POST "$PAGEPIN_BASE/api/sites/my-demo/deploy" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PP_TOKEN" \
  -F "files=@dist/index.html"    -F "paths=index.html" \
  -F "files=@dist/assets/app.js" -F "paths=assets/app.js"
```

The JSON response includes `url` (the link to share), `visibility`, and
`version_count`. **Give `url` to the user after a successful deploy.** Add
`-F "title=My report"` to set the display name.

pagepin renders Markdown and images, so you can deploy them directly — e.g.
`-F "files=@report.md" -F "paths=index.md"` serves a rendered Markdown page
(append `?raw` for the source). A single file with no `index.html` gets an
auto-generated index that opens it.

Make it publicly viewable (auto-reverts to private when the window expires):

```bash
curl -fsS -X PATCH "$PAGEPIN_BASE/api/sites/my-demo" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PP_TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"visibility":"public","public_hours":72}'
```

## Step 4 — the review-comment loop

Colleagues drop pinned, element-level comments on a hosted page. **Before
updating an already-deployed site, fetch the comments first** and clear the
unresolved ones in the same pass:

```bash
curl -fsS "$PAGEPIN_BASE/api/sites/my-demo/comments" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PP_TOKEN"
```

Each thread carries a `selector` (CSS path of the commented element; `"@page"` =
whole-page), a `kind` (`copy` = edit text / `style` / `question` / `bug`), the
`comments`, a `stale` flag, and a deep-link `url`. Locate the element by
`selector`, edit per the feedback, redeploy, then close the loop with the
thread's `id`:

```bash
curl -fsS -X POST "$PAGEPIN_BASE/api/sites/my-demo/comments/$TID/replies" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PP_TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"text":"Updated the button copy; new version published"}'
curl -fsS -X PATCH "$PAGEPIN_BASE/api/sites/my-demo/comments/$TID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PP_TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"resolved":true}'
```

For a `question`-type thread you can't judge, **relay it to the user** instead
of resolving it yourself.

## More

Full endpoint list, large-site (>~90MB) batched upload, version/rollback/delete,
the exact comment-anchor fields, and limits / error codes are in
[`references/api.md`](references/api.md) — bundled with the installed skill, and
also served over HTTP at the same relative path (resolve `references/api.md`
against this guide's URL, e.g. `https://HOST/skill.md` → `https://HOST/references/api.md`).
Authoritative quotas always come from `GET /api/me`.
